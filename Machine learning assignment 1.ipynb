It mainly deals with the unlabeled data. Algorithms are left to their own devises to discover and present the interesting structure in the data. Unsupervised learning is very useful in exploratory analysis because it can automatically identify structure in data. For example, if an analyst were trying to segment consumers, unsupervised clustering methods would be a great starting point for their analysis. In situations where it is either impossible or impractical for a human to propose trends in the data, unsupervised learning can provide initial insights that can then be used to test individual hypotheses.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning problems can be further grouped into clustering and association problems.\n",

    "k-means for clustering problems.\n",
    "Apriori algorithm for association rule learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Semi-supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "The biggest difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning is: Supervised machine learning algorithms are trained on datasets that include labels added by a machine learning engineer or data scientist that guide the algorithm to understand which features are important to the problem at hand. This is a very costly process, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.Unsupervised machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, are trained on unlabeled data and must determine feature importance on their own based on inherent patterns in the data, The most basic disadvantage of any Unsupervised Learning is that it’s application spectrum is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter these disadvantages, the concept of Semi-Supervised Learning was introduced. In this type of learning, the algorithm is trained upon a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. Typically, this combination will contain a very small amount of labeled data and a very large amount of unlabeled data. This is useful for a few reasons. First, the process of labeling massive amounts of data for supervised learning is often prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. What’s more, too much labeling can impose human biases on the model. That means including lots of unlabeled data during the training process actually tends to improve the accuracy of the final model while reducing the time and cost spent building it. You can use unsupervised learning techniques to discover and learn the structure in the input variables. You can also use supervised learning techniques to make best guess predictions for the unlabeled data, feed that data back into the supervised learning algorithm as training data and use the model to make predictions on new unseen data."
