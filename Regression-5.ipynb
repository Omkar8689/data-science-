    "L2 Regularization Impact:\n",
    "The L2 regularization term in Elastic Net helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. It contributes to stabilizing the estimates, especially in the presence of multicollinearity. Even features that are not exactly zero may have reduced magnitudes due to the L2 penalty.\n",
    "Regularization Strength (λ):\n",
    "The regularization strength (λ) controls the overall level of penalization applied to the coefficients. A higher λ increases the level of regularization, which may lead to smaller coefficients and more aggressive feature selection.
