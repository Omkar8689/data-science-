    "You can examine this assumption by plotting the residuals against the predicted values and ensuring that there \n",

    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning to minimize the cost or loss function associated with a model. The goal of machine learning is often to find the parameters of a model that minimize the difference between its predicted output and the actual target values. This is achieved by adjusting the model's parameters iteratively using gradient descent.\n",
