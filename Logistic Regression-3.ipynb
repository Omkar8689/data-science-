    "Standard logistic regression is designed for binary classification problems, where the target variable has only two possible outcomes. However, there are techniques to adapt logistic regression for multiclass classification tasks with more than two classes. Here are two common approaches:\n",

    "Advantages:\n",
    "Simple to implement and understand.\n",

    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "Can be computationally expensive for a large number of classes.\n",

    "Multinomial Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach directly models the probability of each class membership for a data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "It utilizes a softmax function to convert the outputs of a linear model into probabilities that sum to 1 across all classes.\n",

    "Advantages:\n",
