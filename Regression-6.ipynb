    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Scaling typically involves upgrading to a higher-tier plan or physically adding more hardware, which can be time-consuming and may result in downtime.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Offers dynamic scalability, allowing resources to be easily scaled up or down based on demand. This is achieved through features like auto-scaling and on-demand provisioning.\n",
    "Resource Allocation:\n",

    "Traditional Hosting: Resources (CPU, RAM, storage) are often pre-allocated and fixed. Users pay for a predefined set of resources, regardless of whether they fully utilize them.\n",

    "Cost Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Often involves fixed monthly or annual fees. Additional charges may apply for exceeding allocated resources or specific services.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Typically follows a utility-based pricing model. Users pay for the resources they consume, promoting cost efficiency and flexibility.\n",
    "Redundancy and Reliability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Reliability depends on the specific setup of the hosting provider. Redundancy may require additional investments in backup hardware.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Offers built-in redundancy and high availability. Data is often distributed across multiple servers and data centers, reducing the risk of downtime.\n",
    "Management and Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Users have less control over the underlying infrastructure. Configuration changes may require assistance from the hosting provider.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Provides more control over the infrastructure through web-based dashboards or APIs. Users can manage and configure resources independently."
