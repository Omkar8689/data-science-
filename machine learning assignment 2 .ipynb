    "Reducing overfitting in machine learning involves techniques aimed at preventing the model from fitting the training data too closely, allowing it to generalize well to new, unseen data. Here are some common methods to reduce overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization:\n",
    "Introduce regularization terms in the model's cost function to penalize large coefficients or complex structures. This discourages the model from becoming too intricate and helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data. This helps ensure that the model generalizes well across various samples and is not overly tailored to a specific training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Augmentation:\n",
    "Introduce variations in the training data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or cropping. This artificially increases the size of the training set and helps the model become more robust to different input variations.\n",

    "Dropout:\n",

    "Pruning:\n",

    "Early Stopping:\n",
    "Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop the training process when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade. This prevents the model from learning noise in the data and overfitting.\n",

    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "Choose a subset of the most relevant features for training, discarding irrelevant or redundant ones. This reduces the model's complexity and focuses on the most important information.\n",

    "Ensemble Methods:\n",
    "Combine predictions from multiple models using techniques like bagging or boosting. Ensemble methods can reduce overfitting by aggregating predictions from diverse models, each capturing different aspects of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
